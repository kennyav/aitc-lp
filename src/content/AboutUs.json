   "text": "The AI Trust Council was founded by a small group of Commercial Airline Pilots, GWOT Veterans, and EMS Pilots. These individuals have professionally demonstrated their integrity and willingness to sacrifice themselves to help others. They have shown a keen sense of trust and dependability in their personal and professional lives, making them the kind of people who will do the right thing when it really counts, even when no one is watching. Early on, they knew that AI would cause big disruptions to our digital world that would ultimately warp our perception of trust and reality. They didn't want to wait around for \"Big Tech\" to get it right, so they stepped up to do better. At AITC, we care about the future and safety of humanity. We believe that artificial intelligence is an incredible gift that can help humanity, but it needs to be managed extremely carefully. We're here to provide a foothold on trust and reality that is based on real human connections. Trust, Transparency, and the Golden Rule are the founding principles of this organization."
