   "title": "About Us",
   "text": "Our trust council consists of trustworthy individuals, starting with our founders, who are commercial pilots, veterans, firefighters, EMS, nurses, and other public servants. These individuals have demonstrated their integrity and a keen sense of truth in their lives, making them the kind of people who will always do the right thing, even when no one is watching. We're building our trust council on the foundation of human connections, which are forged through shared experiences over time. Our goal is to create a network of individuals who can be trusted for good, honest information, opinions, and intentions. Think of us as a group of your closest friends, family members, or confidants - just good people who are known to do the right thing for you and humanity. At AITC, we believe that artificial intelligence is a gift, but it needs to be managed very carefully. That's why we're here to provide a foothold on trust and reality, so that we can build a brighter future where AI is used as a positive tool for the betterment of humanity."
