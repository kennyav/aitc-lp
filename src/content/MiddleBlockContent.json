    "text": "AITC is using the Nostr platform to power a social trust network where individuals can experience enhanced privacy, transparency, decentralization, and user autonomy over their data. Nostr enhances user privacy by using encryption and decentralizing control over personal data. It achieves this through the distribution of data across relays and clients, making it difficult for any single entity to access or monitor personal information. Users establish connections to relays by using websockets, client software creates connections to the relays. Users have a cryptographic key pair which they use to sign a note and verify a note source. Encryption ensures data security, allowing only authorized recipients with cryptographic keys to decrypt and access shared notes. This allows users to retain complete control over their data, utilizing their cryptographic key pair for signing and verification. This means users have the ultimate authority over their information and can choose with whom to share it.",
