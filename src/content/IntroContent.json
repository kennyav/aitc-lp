  "text": "It's getting harder and harder to determine the authenticity of information online. Our digital perception of reality is getting distorted by the onslaught of bot traffic, misinformation, and fake AI generated content. Hence, we've created the Artificial Intelligence Trust Council as a transparent and unbiased online source of trust. This organization establishes a network of real human connections that can be relied on to create trust online. \n AITC is doing this by leveraging real life human trust networks and representing them online. \n To reach a solid foundation of trust, AITC membership is initially open to Commercial Pilots, EMS Personnel, Fire Fighters, First Responders, Veterans and Air Traffic Controllers. From this core group, AI Council members can establish their own trust networks drawn from people that they personally know and trust. \n By joining the council, members can build their own network by inviting up to five trusted friends, who can then invite their own 5 trusted friends and so on, creating a trustworthy network of individuals.\n Through human connections backed by blockchain technology, AITC establishes an incorruptible network where users can publicly or anonymously share content, communicate ideas and opinions, poll each other, and vote on the validity of online content without the fear of deplatforming or outside censorship. \n If a member posts something, you will know that it's based in truth and honesty. User privacy, meta data usage, content moderation, and monetization is left up to the individual council members to control. This concept brings the free internet back to the individual where trust can be established and maintained.",
